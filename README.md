# WindowGrabber
Easily get back windows that are off-screen! This script pops up a list of your running windows. If you select one, it snaps to the mouse.

Additional modifications and documentation by me. 

I've included the WindowGrabber.exe to download, but AutoHotKey compiled scripts often get flagged by Windows as malware. If you'd like, you can instead save WindowGrabber.AHK and install AutoHotKey to run it or compile it yourself: https://www.autohotkey.com/
